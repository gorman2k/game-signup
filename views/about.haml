  %p Poker Signup is a simple way to register for upcoming poker games and see who else is playing. To keep it as easy as possible, all you need is a known email address to log in. No need to remember yet another password for a website. Signing up for a game is just a matter of clicking a button and then a final email will be sent out to everyone who is "in" with directions. If a game reaches capacity, a waiting list is created.
